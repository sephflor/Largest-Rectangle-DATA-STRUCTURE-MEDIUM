# Largest-Rectangle-DATA-STRUCTURE-MEDIUM.This solution finds the largest rectangular area in a histogram using a stack-based approach that efficiently calculates the maximum rectangle by tracking the left and right boundaries where bars are taller than or equal to the current bar, allowing O(n) time complexity to determine the widest possible rectangle for each bar height.
